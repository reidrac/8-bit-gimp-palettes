These are some GPL (GIMP Palette) files to import in GIMP and do pixel work for
the following microcomputers:

 - ZX Spectrum
 - Amstrad CPC
 - MSX 1 (based on Toshiba palette)
 - Commodore 64
 - Oric

The used values when the specific color is not defined (e.g. MSX) are the ones
Juan J. Mart√≠nez (alias reidrac) uses in conversion tools, so they may or may not work.

These files are in the Public Domain.
You can easily import these palettes on Krita or Photoshop
